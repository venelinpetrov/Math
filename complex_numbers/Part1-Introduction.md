# Complex numbers

## The journey

It's amazing how much disbelieve can hold back science. The famous Bayes theorem, apart from its usefulness in statistics, also has a very human implication. That is, if someone is 0% or 100% sure in something can't be convinced no matter how strong argument you have. There are many examples, from negative and rational numbers, which were viewed as unnatural getting to Cantor's Set Theory named by Wittgenstein and others as pure nonsense. These concepts today are, of course, central and (almost) nobody doubts them anymore. Such a central concept are the complex numbers too.

But there are so many concepts in Mathematics, why regarding this one exactly, what's so special?

>All through the nineteenth century, mathematicians from Abel to Riemann and Weierstrass had been creating a magnificent theory of functions of complex variables. They had discovered that the theory of functions became far deeper and more powerful when it was extended from real to complex numbers. But they always thought of complex numbers as an artificial construction, invented by human mathematicians as a useful and elegant abstraction from real life. It never entered their heads that this artificial number system that they had invented was in fact the ground on which atoms move. They never imagined that nature had got there first.

From "Birds and Frogs" by Freeman Dyson [Notices of Amer. Math. Soc. 56 (2009) 212--223]

In Mathematics you can reliably go from anywhere to anywhere in consistent manner, because it has the property of being self-consistent and self-sufficient. In this essay, the starting point of the travel will be the complex numbers (or somewhere near) and the end of it will be, again, the complex numbers. In other words, we'll taka a tour.

## Why take this journey?

Many students don't ask why. Why the sinusoid looks the wey it does, what it has to do with circles, where do trigonometric functions came from, how did we get from simple triangles to circles, to something so complex like the sinusoid. They just do the calculations respecting some basic logical rules and eventually come to an answers of some unknown question.

If you fit in this picture too, it's very probable that you felt like you were exploited by some dictatorship regime set up by mathematicians. It's time to justify that Mathematics is not some crazy stretch of the mind, it's the key to the profound understanding of nature.

Some may disagree of this somewhat "romantic" point of view that Mathematics is a natural language of some sort. Scepticists would argue that it's indeed a crazy stretch of the mind, **invented** (not discoverd), just to serve the sole purpose of calculating physics and engineering stuff.

While both views are arguable, what's a fact is that both, nature and Methematics, possess the same properties - self-consistency and self-sufficiency. If Mathematics is just how humans express nature, at least this expression maps correctly to nature. Important implication of this is that Mathematics is objective. That is not to say that physics, or chemistry or other sciences are inferior, it's that every science relies on Mathematics so they know they are true.

## Prerequisites

Before you start reading you need to know that at least some mathematical intuition is require to understand this. You don't have to be matematician, I'm not either.
